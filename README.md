# Model-Transformation-BPMN2GAML

This repository contains all the required files to transform a BPMN (Business Process Model Notation) diagram to a GAML code specification.

The transformer is meant to be used with diagrams created from the Eclipse BPMN Modeler, but other .bpmn formats should be compatible,
although more intermediary work will be required

## Features

- Transformation of BPMN diagrams into an intermediary model designed to add agent-based modelling (ABM) elements to the BPMN metamodel
- Generation of an agent specification in GAML from these diagrams

## Installation
