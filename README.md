# Model-Transformation-BPMN2GAML
Source code of a model transformer from BPMN to GAML code

This repository contains all the required files to transform a BPMN (Business Process Model Notation) diagram to a GAML code specification.

The transformer is meant to be fully compatible with diagrams created from the Eclipse BPMN Modeler, but other .bpmn formats should be compatible,
although more intermediary work will be required
